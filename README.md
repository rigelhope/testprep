testprep
========

This is a web app intended for self-testing with user-supplied JSON-formatted question banks.

It is laid out to roughly approximate the multiple-choice portion of the testing UI common to many professional test services, e.g. MCAT, LSAT, etc

Currently, it loads the entire supplied question bank, then allows the user to choose topic-based subsets, and randomizes the order of presentation.

It may be run offline, as a Chrome app.

Future support should include selecting arbitrary XML question banks, a RESTful interface for pulling new question sets from a remote service, support for grouped questions (e.g. matching), and others.

The license is GPLv3.
